# Bruh Dupe

- Autoduper for ECME (patched) or any paper 1.16 server
- Meant to be paired with '.d' mod but automates the process.
- Stand near a chest and aim where you want the items to be dropped, and enable it with '.autodupe start'
- The duper can be stopped by '.autodupe stop' if you can type it in time, or just by pressing ESC
